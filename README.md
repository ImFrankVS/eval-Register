# eval-Register
eval-Register is designed for quick evaluations of high-density electrophysiological recordings. It works with .brw files generated by BioCamX using BrainWave 4 software from 3brain. The graphical interface was developed with Qt, and the backend was created at CINVESTAV using Julia.
